Animations, prefabs, sprites, waterframes, _scenes folder should be under assets.

.pngs are sometimes missing, so sprites and water frames are added in .rar files.

unity github plugin sometimes causes errors on launch, but can be avoided by deleting the plugin folder.

I am really seriously sorry for any github issues. I have a lot of trouble getting it to work, I do not understand what I am doing. 
It doesn't make sense to me and usually I know what I am doing. -Freeman
